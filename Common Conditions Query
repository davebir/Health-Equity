Question:
What are the most common conditions for patients in specific age groups?


SELECT
  Age_Catagory,
  description AS Conditions,
  COUNT(*) AS Condition_Count
FROM (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, birthdate)) BETWEEN 0 AND 18 THEN 'Child'
      WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, birthdate)) BETWEEN 19 AND 66 THEN 'Adult'
      ELSE 'Elderly'
    END AS Age_Catagory,
    conditions.description
  FROM patients
  LEFT JOIN conditions ON patients.id = conditions.patient
)
GROUP BY Age_Catagory, Conditions
ORDER BY Age_Catagory, Condition_Count DESC;



How I did this:
I first needed to create a query that would help me solve each patient's age based on their date of birth since their age was not given. In my case statement, I used
the DATE_PART function to extract the year from the nested function AGE, which found the difference between today's current date and their birthdate. With each patient's age, I put
them into three categories: Child, Adult, and Elderly. I gave this case statement the alias "Age_Catagory".

The "description" column is from the Conditions table, which needs a left join.

I then grouped by Age_Catagory and Conditions and ordered by Age_Catagory and Condition_Count in descending order. 



Description:
This was a question that I wanted to answer for two reasons:
1. Preventative Healthcare: With this data, we can see which conditions are occurring the most frequently at specific ages and incorporate more screening, medications, vaccines, lifestyle changes, etc. 
2. Better Resource Allocation: Our healthcare industry has limited resources. If we can better understand how to allocate these resources when we know these specific conditions are happening among children, adults, and the elderly,
   we can be more efficient and save more lives.
