# How many patients in the dataset belong to each racial or ethnic group?

SELECT
	race,
	ethnicity,
	COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM patients
GROUP BY
	race,
	ethnicity
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;

Commentary: Since race and ethnicity are in separate columns, I selected both and the count function and gave it the alias "patient_coount". This is in the "patients" table and grouped race and ethnicity. I then ordered the "patient_count" in descending order.
