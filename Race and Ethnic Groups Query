Question:
How many patients in the dataset belong to each racial or ethnic group?

SELECT
	race,
	ethnicity,
	COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM patients
GROUP BY
	race,
	ethnicity
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;

What I did:
Since race and ethnicity are in separate columns, I selected race, ethnicity, and the count function. I then gave it the alias "patient_count". 
Race and ethnicity are in the "patients" table. I then grouped by race and ethnicity and ordered the "patient_count" in descending order.
