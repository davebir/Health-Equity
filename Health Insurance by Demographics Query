Question: What percentage of patients have health insurance? How does it vary by demographics?


SELECT
  ROUND(
	COUNT(
	  	CASE
		  	WHEN 
			  	healthcare_coverage > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS perentage_of_patients_with_coverage
FROM
	patients;



What I did:
I first created a case statement that would help me count all patients with health insurance. In the table "patients", there are two columns: "healthcare_expenses" and
"healthcare_coverage." In the "healthcare_coverage" column, those with no coverage had a 0 in their row. 

So, I had SQL give a 1 if "healthcare_coverage" was greater than 0 and then used the COUNT function to count all of the 1's. I multiplied this by 100.0 to better prep
this number for the next stage. I then had SQL count every patient and divided the number of patients with insurance by every patient in the table. I used the round 
function to round to two decimal points and gave it the alias "percentage_of_patients_with_coverage". 


Using this same query, I can use the group by function to see how insurance varies by demographics:


SELECT
race,
ROUND(
	COUNT(
		CASE
			WHEN 
				healthcare_coverage > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS perentage_of_patients_with_coverage
FROM
	patients
GROUP BY race
ORDER BY perentage_of_patients_with_coverage DESC;



Commentary:
I wanted to know if all our patients had health coverage (insurance). This is beneficial for a least two reasons:
1. Patients with health insurance are more likely to seek preventative care and follow-up visits than those who do not have insurance. This leads to better health overall and less
   expenses for hospitals when a condition becomes bad enough for an emergency surgery.
2. When a hospital performs surgery for an uninsured patient, there is no guarantee the hospital will receive payment for their services. This adds financial burdens on the hospital
   to make sure it makes its payroll, utilities, lease payments, etc.
