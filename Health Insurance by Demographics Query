Question: What percentage of patients have health insurance? How does it vary by demographics?

SELECT
  ROUND(
	COUNT(
	  	CASE
		  	WHEN 
			  	healthcare_coverage > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS perentage_of_patients_with_coverage
FROM
	patients;

What I did:
I first created a case statement that would help me count all patients with health insurance. In the table "patients", there are two columns: "healthcare_expenses" and
"healthcare_coverage." In the "healthcare_coverage" column, those with no coverage had a 0 in their row. 

So, I had SQL give a 1 if "healthcare_coverage" was greater than 0 and then used the COUNT function to count all of the 1's. I multiplied this by 100.0 to better prep
this number for the next stage. I then had SQL count every patient and divided the number of patients with insurance by every patient in the table. I used the round 
function to round to two decimal points and gave it the alias "percentage_of_patients_with_coverage". 

Commentary:
I wanted to find out if all our patients had health coverage (insurance). This is beneficial for a few reasons:
